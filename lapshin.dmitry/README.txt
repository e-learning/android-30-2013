Number - simple number from input
Variable - variable with the value stored. For now only X is avalible

=== Supported values ===
* Double  - double
* Integer - int with abs <= 1e9
+ Fractions
+ Sum of square roots
	Like (2 * sqrt(5) - 3 * sqrt(7)) / 2
+ PI * Integer/Fraction

=== Supported functions ===
* operator +
* operator -
* operator *
* operator /
* braces
* \(a)
	Just skinning for braces, better use this!
* \sqrt(a)
	square root from <a>
* \integral(l,r,e,v)
	intgral of function 
+ \sin(a)
+ \cos(a)
+ \tan(a)
+ \arcsin(a)
+ \arccos(a)
+ \arctan(a)
+ \fraction(a,b)
+ LOTS!!!!
